# decimal-to-degree-coord-converter

The main purpose of this simple project is to convert a DMS to D coordinate system to a batch file

I had used to map an CSV input file to enable the output to a Output file

## Running the file
index -- input fileInput.csv --output fileName.csv

## tests
yarn test
